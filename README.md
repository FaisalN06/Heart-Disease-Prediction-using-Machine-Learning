# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various health-related features. Early prediction can help in taking timely medical action, ultimately saving lives.

## 🧠 Objective

To build an accurate and reliable machine learning model that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart disease using patient data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease), which contains the following features:

* Age
* Sex
* Chest pain type (cp)
* Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
* Serum cholesterol (chol)
* Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
* Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)
* Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
* Exercise-induced angina (exang)
* ST depression induced by exercise (oldpeak)
* Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope)
* Number of major vessels (ca)
* Thalassemia (thal)
* Target (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 ML Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## ✅ Features
